# Documentation of my website MISSGUIDED and its API:

**MISSGUIDED** is a UK-based multi-channel retailer selling clothes aimed at 16-35 year old women. 
It has its exclusive app available in app store on Iphone and in google play on Android. 

The website that I have created using HTML5 and CSS is a simple user responsive website 
which has several human-website interactive features and a subscription form to allow the 
user to join the exclusive mailing list of the clothing brand and stay connected with MISSGUIDED. This subscription gives the access to ongoing sale offers, newsletters and outfit suggestions in the form of mails which are sent
to their emails. 

Starting from the top, I programmed a sticky navigation bar and incorporated the company's logo on
the left hand corner along with the sub headings of the single page website on the right which are 

- Home
- Most Wanted
- About
- Subcribe 
- Connect

This navigation bar sticks to the top as we scroll down until a certain portion on the website after which it disappears. The sub headings are intitally coloured a light gray but after hovering the mouse over them, pop out with a darker gray colour to highlight the option hovered over. 

I added a dynamic image slider which automatically swipes between 3 pictures. The user can also manually browse through the images using the slider below the images. The images in CSS were programmed to fit the whole screen to add to the appeal of the website. Below this image slider I created a gray background screen for my text and button. This button is the **SUBSCRIBE** button which takes the user to the official websiste's sign up page. The user is also given the option to, instead of subscribing then, scroll down later to the subscription form that is created towards the end of the page or by clicking on the subscribe option available on the navigation bar. 

The gray background is limited just to the text and the button. Moving down, we have our **Most Wanted** section of the website. This section has a heading in bold and is underlined by a long rule to separate the subheading and the head. ( all the beautification, shape and sizing are conducted in CSS )
The next bit is divided into three columns each titled with the relevant icons I took from the Font Awesome website. A brief summary of what each section stands for is mentioned beneath the column in a tabular manner.

I incorporated row paddings and gave widh to them, creating barriers between the various sections in the website. Next we have the **About Us** section. This section is a mixture of text, gifs and an interactive button which directs the user to the instagram feed of the CEO of MISSGUIDED, Nitin Passi. The separate formattings of the subheadings and sub-texts were all conducted in CSS. 

After this we have our free **Subscribe** form on which our client side and server side javascripting are based. The user fills in his name and email address which are required fields and appropriate error messages are displayed if not filled in or if wrongly filled in. The email address is checked for it validity and the subscription is'nt processed until an email address in the required format is entered. Once the user is successful in filling in the details accurately, an approriate message welcoming the user to the mailing list is displayed. The user now does'nt have any more access to the subscription box for a week from the same server (eg: Firefox, Safari, Chrome). This is to avoid anymore subscriptions from the same user. One subscription per user per week from the same server only. 

We then have our **Connect** section encouraging users to connect with MISSGUIDED on various platforms to stay in touch and up to date with various trends, projects and looks from celebrities etc. Each of the 3 social media platforms are respectively linked to MISSGUIDED's official social media platforms. 

This concluded my website. This website is compatible on both laptops and mobile devices. The texts, images and form accordingly accomodate to the change in screens and there is so disarrangement of any of the items on the website. Upon narrowing of the website on mobile device, the navigation bar accomodates by creating a list of the sub headings in a 3 lined icon. Upon clicking this icon, we can see the items of the navigation bar drop down. 

The server side of this website is ensured by linking my email address to the subscription form so every successful entry of the form is sent to me and then I can accordingly add the valid email addresses to the mailing list in my mail box. 

This concludes the breakdown of my website. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed making it!

Thanks,

Kanika Mehta
